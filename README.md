# Golf_Scoring_Avg_CLI_App

Difficulties:
- Figuring out nested while loops to keep user from 
  moving forward without putting relevant numbers in
- figuring out how to print out handicaps properly, 
  with correct decimals and putting "+" in front of
  below par handicaps
- Coming up with the best way to navigate through the program 
  Example: allowing user to input multiple scores at once vs. one score at a time
=> I figured it was simpler to input scores one at a time to cast each string to int 
  and to reduce chances of user error.
